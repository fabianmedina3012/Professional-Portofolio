            <p class="about-me">
                Hello, my name is Fabian Medina, I was born and I am from Venezuela. I am 20 years old. I have been in the United States for five years. I am from the capital of my country Caracas.  
            </p>
            <p class="about-me">
                Caracas was where I lived all my childhood and half of my adolescence. My arrival here was due to political problems and a lot of insecurity in my country. My parents decided to come to live here, specifically in Parkland, Florida. My adaptation process in this country was a little difficult for me since I did not have the best possible English and I never dared to do many things for the same fear that I would be judged for my English, even so, I was able to graduate from Marjory High School Stoneman Douglas and being able to go to university while working.
            </p>
            <p class="about-me">
                My hobby and my second job is photography. I have been a photographer for a year and a half and I have loved many of the experiences I have had throughout this time, I have met many people from many places and I have created good moments with friends. When I started my career at the College of Computer Science, I understood that I did not want to last so long at the university to be able to have my degree and be able to work, so I decided to take the bootcamp coding course to advance much faster and be able to achieve my goals. faster.
