# Professional-Portofolio
A portfolio of work can showcase your skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. An effective portfolio highlights your strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it

## Usage 
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position.

## Challenge 
This challenge was more focused on how to use CSS, using images and codes that help us put things in their place and have a little more personality with the colors but never failing to meet the expectations of the class. This project we can see that it is a summary of my projects so far at the beginning of the course and where I will put more as this progresses.
